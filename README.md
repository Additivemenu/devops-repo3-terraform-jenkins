## network module in root `main.tf` file 

Certainly, I'd be happy to explain this `main.tf` file. This file is using a Terraform module, which is a key concept in Terraform for organizing and reusing code.

Let's break down the content:

```
module "networking" {
  source = "./networking"
  vpc_cidr = var.vpc_cidr
  vpc_name = var.vpc_name
  cidr_public_subnet = var.cidr_public_subnet
  eu_availability_zone = var.eu_availability_zone
  cidr_private_subnet = var.cidr_private_subnet
}

```

This code block is declaring a module named "networking". Here's what each part means:

1. `module "networking"`: This line starts the module block and gives it the name "networking". This name is used to reference the module elsewhere in your Terraform configuration.
2. `source = "./networking"`: This specifies where Terraform can find the module's source code. In this case, it's pointing to a local directory named "networking" in the same directory as this `main.tf` file.
3. The remaining lines are passing variables to the module:
    - `vpc_cidr = var.vpc_cidr`
    - `vpc_name = var.vpc_name`
    - `cidr_public_subnet = var.cidr_public_subnet`
    - `eu_availability_zone = var.eu_availability_zone`
    - `cidr_private_subnet = var.cidr_private_subnet`
    
    These lines are setting the module's input variables. The `var.` prefix indicates that these values are coming from variables defined elsewhere in your Terraform configuration (likely in a `variables.tf` file).
    

This module appears to be setting up networking infrastructure, likely creating a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with public and private subnets in a specific availability zone.

To use this configuration:

1. You would need to have a `./networking` directory containing the module's source code (likely including its own `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and possibly `outputs.tf`).
2. You would also need to define the variables being used (vpc_cidr, vpc_name, etc.) in your root module or pass them when running Terraform.

This approach allows you to encapsulate all the networking-related resources in a separate module, making your code more organized and potentially reusable across different projects.





## `.tfvars` file

A `.tfvars` file in Terraform is used to define variable values separately from the main configuration files. Let me explain its purpose and usage:

1. Purpose of .tfvars files:
    - Separate configuration from code
    - Provide environment-specific values
    - Keep sensitive information out of your main Terraform code
    - Easily switch between different configurations
2. How it works:
    - Variables are declared in your main Terraform files (usually in a `variables.tf` file)
    - The `.tfvars` file provides specific values for these variables
    - When you run Terraform commands, it automatically loads variables from files named `terraform.tfvars` or `.auto.tfvars`
3. In the context of your project:
The `terraform.tfvars` file you've shown contains specific values for your infrastructure setup, such as VPC CIDR blocks, subnet configurations, and an EC2 AMI ID. These values can be referenced in your main Terraform configuration files.
4. Benefits:
    - Keeps your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - Allows for easier management of different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production)
    - Improves security by separating potentially sensitive values from your code
5. Usage:
    - Terraform automatically loads `terraform.tfvars` if present
    - You can also specify a different .tfvars file using the `var-file` option:
        
        ```
        terraform apply -var-file="production.tfvars"
        
        ```
        
6. Example:
In your main Terraform files, you might have:
    
    ```
    variable "vpc_cidr" {
      type = string
    }
    
    ```
    
    And in your `terraform.tfvars`:
    
    ```
    vpc_cidr = "11.0.0.0/16"
    
    ```
    

This separation allows you to maintain different configurations for different environments or use cases while keeping the core Terraform code the same.
